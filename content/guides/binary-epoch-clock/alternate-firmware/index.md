We always envisioned the [Binary Epoch Clock](/product/becv1/) as being able to be more than just a simple clock. Along with adding a new, more readable, clock face and 1D pong to the official firmware since launch, here are some alternative firmwares that will make it more than just a clock:




  * [EpochPOV](/2013/10/21/introducing-epochpov/): Turn your BEC into a fully functional Persistence of Vision display with 32 pixels of resolution. Fun for the whole family!
  * [Proton Pack Power Meter](http://maniacallabs.com/2013/09/19/who-ya-gonna-call/): Not just firmware, but an adapter circuit board as well to make the BEC into a pulsing power meter for your Ghostbusters Proton Pack or just about anything else.
