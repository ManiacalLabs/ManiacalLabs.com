For those that missed the Kickstarter or just want more, this means that you can order RIGHT NOW! They are being sold through our manufacturing partner [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/).

We realize that shipping from China can be slow and may not be convenient for everyone, but fear not, we are working hard to find distributors that will help bring the AllPixel a little closer to home for as many people as possible. Since we know our supporters are all over the world; if there is a domestic distributor you enjoy doing business with, please leave a link in the comments below and we'll do what we can.

Just look at all the places the AllPixel has gone to already!
