We are excited to announce that we now offer 3D printing services!

We've had a MakerBot Replicator 2 for a while now, which we absolutely love, and now we want to share it.

This is a bit of an experiment, so we're trying it all out via [MakeXYZ](http://makexyz.com); a great community of 3D printer owners and those who need 3D printed items. It typically deals with connecting local people, but we will ship to anywhere in the USA.

Check out our [profile @ MakeXYZ](http://www.makexyz.com/printer/maniacallabs) if you would like us to print something for you!
