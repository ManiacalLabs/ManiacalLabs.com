In 2014 we launched the [AllPixel](/AllPixel): an easy way to control various kinds of digital RGB LEDs. This time, we wanted something that would bring that same level of ease to analog RGB LEDs. Enter the [LongPixel](/LongPixel).

{{< youtube QIRYZglR6cM >}}

The [LongPixel](/LongPixel) is able to drive 12-24V Common Anode RGB LED analog strips (the kind that have +V, R, G, and B wires). By using the WS2801 LED driver chip, multiple LongPixels can be chained together and treated as a "strip" of digitally addressable super-LEDs. The [LongPixel](/LongPixel) can work with just about any platform that supports SPI communication, including the Arduino, the Raspberry Pi, and our AllPixel LED controller.  The awesome [FastLED](http://fastled.io) Arduino/AVR library and our own [BiblioPixel](/BiblioPixel) Python library are great control software options. Screw terminals, standard headers, and integrated mounting points make hardware setup a snap.

Some example uses: Architectural Lighting, Costumes, Under counters or cabinets, TV Bias Lighting, or Music Interactive Lighting.

As with all our work, the [LongPixel](/LongPixel) is 100% open and all of the design files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/LongPixel).

To help get the [LongPixel](/LongPixel) into the hands of LED lovers at a reasonable cost, weâ€™re launching a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maniacallabs/longpixel-digital-control-for-analog-led-strips) to help fund an initial run of the boards. We are also offering rolls of analog LEDs at a discount to backers: $25 or less for 5 meters.
