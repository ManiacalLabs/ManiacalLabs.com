Thank you SO MUCH to all of our amazing backers! We couldn't be happier with how well the [AllPixel campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101128588/allpixel-usb-interface-for-all-your-led-needs/) went!

Now... the hard work begins. We've already started working with Seeed Studio to begin the manufacturing process and hope to have the rewards out to everyone even before our April timeline.

For those who might have missed the deadline or think they may want more, fear not. We plan on having more AllPixel and PowerTap kits available for sale through Seeed and distributors shortly after the backer rewards go out.

This is only the beginning. Stay tuned!

Happy Making!
