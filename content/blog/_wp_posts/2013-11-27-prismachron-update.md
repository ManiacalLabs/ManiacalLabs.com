First of all, many thanks to those who supported our [PrismaChron](https://www.tindie.com/products/ManiacalLabs/prismachron-clock/) Tindie fundraiser!

Unfortunately, there wasn't enough interest in this particular project to reach our funding goal. So we won't, at this time, be making the PrismaChron, but it was not a worthless experience for us. We learned a great deal in the process.

While crowd-funding didn't work out this time, we still see great potential in it, given the right product. So we are not discouraged... just the opposite. We're already working on another set of kits that we are _very_ excited about and will be announcing in the coming months. So stay tuned!
