Happy New Year!

While one of the many reasons we created the [AllPixel](/AllPixel) was to be able to control LED strips from "traditional" desktops and laptops (with the extra processing power they provide), we are always on the lookout for something smaller and cheaper that can just be left in a project. We talked a lot about the ever popular Raspberry Pi and Beagle Bone Black, but as [this list](http://linuxgizmos.com/ringing-in-2015-with-40-linux-friendly-hacker-sbcs/) from [LinuxGizmos.com](http://linuxgizmos.com/ringing-in-2015-with-40-linux-friendly-hacker-sbcs/) shows, there are _many_ more great options to choose from. Many of them are a great deal faster than the Pi or Beagle, which has always been the major downside to those boards... we just couldn't get the performance out of them we wanted.

One that we are particularly excited to try out is the [ODROID-C1](http://ameridroid.com/products/odroid-c1). It has the same basic form factor as the Raspberry Pi B+, but comes with a quad-core 1.5Ghz CPU, 1GB of RAM and Gigabit Ethernet, for the same $35 price as the Pi! That should really crank out some pixels to the AllPixel! But that's just one of the many awesome options in that list. As long as it runs Python (anything running Linux should) and has a USB host port (most of them), it should work with the AllPixel!

Happy Making in 2015!
