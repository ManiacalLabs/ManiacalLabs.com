Now this is just plain cool. And insane. Every once in a while I see a project that really makes me question how much I know about electronics design and this is certainly one of them. Instead of a microprocessor, or even plain-old discrete transistors, all of the logic of this clock is accomplished with nothing more than neon lamps. Whaaaat? I won't even try to explain, but let the designer explain over on [his site](http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/neonclock/).
