We [previously released](/2015/01/23/adafruit-matrix-hat-support-for-bibliopixel/) a new [BiblioPixel](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel/wiki) driver that supports the [Adafruit Matrix Hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2345) and the performance was not great. That's all changed with the Raspberry Pi 2!
