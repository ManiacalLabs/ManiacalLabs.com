I was playing around with the Replicator 2 and this popped out. I took the bottom half of the case for the [AllPixel](/allpixel/)Â and merged it into a stand for the [WyoLum](http://wyolum.com) TinyTiM (which is due to go on sale shortly, check their store). The TinyTiM is held upright similar to the way some tablet stands work. I used solid core wires to connect the AllPixel to the TinyTiM. This allows for the exact angle to be adjusted and adds some stability. I'll be posting the design files on the [AllPixel github repo](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/AllPixel) soon.
