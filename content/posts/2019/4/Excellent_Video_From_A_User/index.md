A few weeks back we got an email from [Steve Mulanax](https://github.com/SteveMulanax) letting us know about a video he had made, explaining how to create some awesome animated stars using [BiblioPixel](/bibliopixel) and the [AllPixel Mini](/allpixel). We were astounded by the amount of time and effort put into the video, as well as how clearly he went through his entire process.

Being a good open source citizen, he of course includes links to source code and CAD models in the video description. He even submitted the animation code to [BiblioPixelAnimations](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixelAnimations/tree/master/BiblioPixelAnimations/strip/Emitter) so everyone else can use it easily.

We salute you, Steve, for putting together such a great tutorial!
