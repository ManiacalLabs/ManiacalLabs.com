Hard to believe it's been over 5 years since we started Maniacal Labs and kicked it off with a somewhat [cryptic post](/2013/04/26/no-good-can-come-of-this/). It's been a fun ride since then and it just seemed about time to clean house and rebuild the website. While there's defintely some new exciting stuff in the piepline, not really much else to report here. But be sure to follow us on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or GitHub (see links at top of page) to stay up to date!

For those that care about the technical aspects, and why our new site is so insanely fast to load... The old site was all running on Wordpress, which may be ubiquitous but is not exactly svelte. But now, it's entirely generated by the amazing(ly fast) [Hugo Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io/). Not only that, but it's backed by a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/ManiacalLabs.com), rendered by [Travis CI](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/ManiacalLabs.com/blob/master/.travis.yml), and served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's turned out to be a beautifuly elegant solution.

All for now! Enjoy the new site!
