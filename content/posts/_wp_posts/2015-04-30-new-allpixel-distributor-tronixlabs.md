Good news, people of Australia! The AllPixel just got a bit closer to you :)
Our friends over at [TronixLabs](http://tronixlabs.com/) now have both AllPixel and PowerTap kits [for sale](http://tronixlabs.com/brands/Maniacal-Labs.html) in their store.

For those not in Australia, fear not. We're still working on landing more distributors around the world and hope to have more to announce soon. If there's a specific distributor you would like to see carry the AllPixel there are two things you can do to help:




  * Let us know in the comments below so we can pitch the kits to them.
  * Send _them_ a message, asking them to carry the AllPixel. We can pitch products all day long, but customer demand is what will really drive their decision.


Happy Making!
