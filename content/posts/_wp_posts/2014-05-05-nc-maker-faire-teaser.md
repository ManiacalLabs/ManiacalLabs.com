Just a quick teaser for the upcoming [NC Maker Faire](http://www.makerfairenc.com/) on June 7th.

{{< youtube lammzULkqYg >}}

These are just some animation tests for my new LED display.

It's a 24 x 24 pixel LED matrix built from [LPD8806 LED strips](http://www.adafruit.com/product/306) and mounted on a 24" x 24" sheet of acrylic. The animations are generated by some python code running on a Raspberry Pi.

More details and code will be coming soon. Stop by the Maker Faire to see it in action!
