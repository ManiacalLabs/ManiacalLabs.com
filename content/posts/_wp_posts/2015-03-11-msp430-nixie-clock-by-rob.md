I saw [this kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/RobG/msp430-nixie-clock-kit/) come up in Tindie's twitter feed, and instantly knew that I wanted one. It's relatively inexpensive, not very complex, and it looks amazing (especially with the acrylic front and back plates). And Nixie Tubes! I love the effect and being able to see the inner workings of these very much Old School display devices. The build was pretty straight-forward, and I'm really happy with the final product. It turns out that Rob was sitting a few tables down from us at NC Maker Faire last year. He is a wizard with the TI MSP430 platform, and has a bunch of really neat kits to go along with it on his [Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/RobG/). He also frequents the [43oh.com forums](http://forum.43oh.com/), which is a great resource for anyone looking to get into the MSP430 platform. I have a [LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads-msp430-msp-exp430g2.html#tabs) somewhere in my workshop. I'll have to dig it out and take a peak at the code. More on that as it happens. But for now I just wanted to share a few shots from my build:
