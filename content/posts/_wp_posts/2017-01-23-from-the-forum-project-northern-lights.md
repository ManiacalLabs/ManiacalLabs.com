Hello! We're not dead yet! Now that the holidays are behind us, we're going to get back into the swing of posting more content on a regular basis. We've got some neat things coming up, so stay tuned. In the meantime, check out this Freaking Awesome [arcade joystick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SReobLBU1_A) built by forum user [mlapsa]. [BiblioPixel](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel) was used to control the LED strips inside of the wood and Lexan case. Excellent work!
