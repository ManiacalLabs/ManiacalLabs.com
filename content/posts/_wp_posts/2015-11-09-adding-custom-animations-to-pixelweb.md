Last week, we launched [PixelWeb](/PixelWeb) which comes with all of the animations in our [animations repository](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixelAnimations) but that only gets you so far. You want to add your own of course! Fortunately, it's not a particularly complicated process and just requires adding a little extra information to your animation file so that PixelWeb knows what to do with it. Check out the video below and read up on the process on the [PixelWeb Wiki](/u/Manifest) to learn how.
