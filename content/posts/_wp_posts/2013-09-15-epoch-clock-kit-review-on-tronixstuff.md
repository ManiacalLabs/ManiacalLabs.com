John over at [tronixstuff.com](http://tronixstuff.com/) has a [review](http://tronixstuff.com/2013/09/15/kit-review-maniacal-labs-epoch-clock/) of our Epoch Clock kit. He offers a great walk-through of the un-boxing and building experiences, complete with pictures. He also offers a great explanation of [Unix time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). A big thanks to John for his consideration of our product! And, of course, we're glad he liked it!
