Time for everyone's favorite segment... err, never done this one before. And it's something we ordered... but for other people, so we'll say it counts.

For the awesome folks at [TriEmbed](http://triembed.org/blog/), our local electronics enthusiast group, we decided to put together a bulk order of LEDs with the manufacturer we are using for the [AllPixel](/AllPixel) Kickstarter rewards. It's not everyday you get $2000 worth (more like $5000 street value) of LEDs in the mail, so it seemed best to document the unboxing.

Enjoy!
