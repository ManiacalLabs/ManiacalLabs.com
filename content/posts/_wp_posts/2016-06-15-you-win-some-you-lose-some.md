First, we want to thank everyone who showed support for the LongPixel by pledging to our Kickstarter campaign. It's always wonderful to see that our crazy ideas aren't actually crazy and that other people like what they see and want to give it a shot.

However, we're sorry to say that we didn't make it this time with the LongPixel. For those of you that were hoping to get one, we're sorry that it won't be happening right now.

But we've still got plenty of future plans and are not going anywhere. So be sure to keep an eye on what we're up to via Facebook, Twitter, or ManiacalLabs.com
