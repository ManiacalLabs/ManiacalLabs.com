If you have ever soldered together a bit of electronic whatsits that you purchased in kit form, and if you have an appreciation for making and/or repairing your own electronic stuff, then this news should grab your attention.

A quick lesson: Heathkit was a line of electronics kits sold by the Heath Company starting after World War 2. The kits ranged from the name-making oscilloscope kit to amateur radio kits to famous Heathkit H8 digital computer. Talk to anyone that was (or whose parents were) interested in electronics kits "back in the day" and Heathkit will almost certainly come up.

I admit that Heathkit was a bit before my time, but when you hear people talk about it, there is a air of reverence and respect. I have a great appreciation for these early Makers, and for the history (thatÂ _they lived through) _that has led me to my chosen profession. For me personally, being able to build a Heathkit would be, to use a technical term, friggin' awesome.

The three of us, with our ridiculous concoctions, pay tribute to the ideals that Heathkit instilled in generations past, and (hopefully) will do once again for this and future generations.
