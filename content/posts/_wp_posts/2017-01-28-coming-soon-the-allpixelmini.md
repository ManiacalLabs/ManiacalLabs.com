Good News, Everyone! We've been toying around with the idea of updating the design for our [AllPixel LED Controler](/allpixel/) for a while now, and we're making great progress. The image above is our first prototype, fresh from [MacroFab](https://macrofab.com/). Everything looks good so far! Here's a few noteworthy notes on the new design:




      * **Fully Assembled:** No user soldering required!
      * **Tiny:** Measures in at about 1.6 x 1.2 inches (40.6 x 30.5 mm)
      * **Updated USB:**Now uses the more common micro USB


We're excited to get our hands on this first prototype, and we'll be starting to reach out to our contract manufacturers in the very near future. Stay tuned to [our site](/) for more updates as they happen!
