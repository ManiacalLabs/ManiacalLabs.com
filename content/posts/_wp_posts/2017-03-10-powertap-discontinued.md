Back when we launched the AllPixel, we also created a small device called the PowerTap that eases the task of splicing power at various points along a strip of LEDs. We sold many during the Kickstarter but they never really sold well after the fact. We've actually never made more after the original batch from the Kickstarter! As of last night we sold the last of that batch.

It's not really worth our time or money to produce more but, if you want some, have no fear... they are open source and you can still get your own!

First head over to OSHPark: [https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zyTngLzg](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zyTngLzg)
It's $4.15 for 3 boards.

Then, order 3 or more copies of this project on Mouser: [http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=b3649fa0ae](http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=b3649fa0ae)

We do realize that this ends up being more expensive than what we sold the PowerTap for ($5 each) but this is mainly due to the cost of the two screw terminals. If you want to add one more place to order from, just find a 2.54mm (0.1") pitch, 4 pin screw terminal from ebay like [this one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-4-Poles-4-Pin-2-54mm-0-1-PCB-Universal-Screw-Terminal-Block-Connector-/321417281839?hash=item4ad5f6812f:g:68UAAMXQuCdThVBS). They are not as good quality, but _much_ cheaper.

Alternatively, you can just leave out the terminals all together and directly solder the LED strip leads to the power tap. Either of these options can bring the total per PowerTap cost down to or below the $5 we sold them for, assuming you are OK with skimping on the terminals a bit.

Also, we are aware that the AllPixel is out of stock both on Tindie and Seeed but fear not! A [new version](/2017/01/28/coming-soon-the-allpixelmini/) is coming very soon :)
