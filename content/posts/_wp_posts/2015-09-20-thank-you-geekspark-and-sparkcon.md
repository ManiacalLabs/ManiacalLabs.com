A Huge Thanks to everyone who came out and saw us at GeekSpark this weekend! We had a great time and were thrilled at the response we got from the giant display.

If you want to know more about the AllPixel LED driver and the BiblioPixel Python library that were used to make the display, check out the [AllPixel Info Page](/allpixel/).

We'll have a more detailed post up later with some more pictures.

Thanks for checking us out!
