Many thanks to all our awesome backers for helping us get this far! We're not even half way through the campaign and already over 50% funding :) We can make it, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have a little help. We are doing our best to get the word out there, but we ask that you give us a hand: share on social media, tell your friends, tell your favorite electronics DIY blog. With a little bit of help, we can make this happen and bring the LongPixel to the world :)

Thanks for being awesome!
