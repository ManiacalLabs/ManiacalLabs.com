Last night, we got some really disappointing news; [Maker Faire North Carolina](http://www.makerfairenc.com/) will not be happening this year :(

Last year's faire was an exceptional experience and the [AllPixel](/Allpixel) may not have happened without it. Having been planning for and looking forward to exhibiting at the 2015 faire since the moment the 2014 one ended, this was horribly crushing to hear. But as they explain on their [website](http://www.makerfairenc.com/), it was not an easy decision, but simply became more than the organizers could handle in their spare time.

We sincerely hope that the Maker community can rally together and make it a possibility to bring a Maker Faire back to Raleigh. There will be a giant void in our year without it.
