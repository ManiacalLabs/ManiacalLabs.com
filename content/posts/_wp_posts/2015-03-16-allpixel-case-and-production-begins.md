The last week has been seriously busy here at Maniacal Labs HQ since we got the AllPixel production samples! Fortunately, the samples all check out and we gave the go-ahead to start production this week which, barring any issues, should also finish this week. Then comes kitting and packaging (done by Seeed) and then they get shipped out to the backers!

Second we've just released printable design files for a nice little case for the AllPixel:

The designs are all available on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:725143) and the [AllPixel GitHub](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/AllPixel/tree/master/Case) repository. If you don't have access to a 3D printer yourself, we highly recommend [MakeXYZ](makexyz.com), [3dHubs.com](3dhubs.com), or [Shapeways](shapeways.com) to get one printed for you.
