We showed off this fun little piece of code in the [AllPixel Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101128588/allpixel-usb-interface-for-all-your-led-needs/) introduction video, but never really got into the details of how that audio animation really worked.

The animation in the introduction video and the video above uses a [Fast Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) to analyze the audio coming into the computer's mic/line-in and generate an intensity map for various frequency ranges in the audio signal. FFT is some really hardcore math, so instead of trying to explain the details of how it, and the python code, works see [this post](http://www.swharden.com/blog/2013-05-09-realtime-fft-audio-visualization-with-python/) (and it's links) on the blog of Scott Harden. His code was modified to provide the correct number of data points for a given matrix size and to work with the [BaseMatrixAnimation](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel/wiki/Animations#class-basematrixanim) class in BiblioPixel.

            for x in range(self.width):
                for y in range(self.height):
                    if y < int(eq_data[x]):
                        self._led.set(x, self.height - y - 1, self.colors[y])

To do all of this, you will need to install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which does the FFT) and [PyAudio](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) which captures the audio. If running on Windows, it is highly recommended to grab these [pre-compiled binaries](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) for both packages. Otherwise the installation can be quite a pain.

Then, for capturing the audio, things can get a little weird. On *nix type systems (including OS X) it is very possible that the code above will capture the system output audio with no fuss. But my mileage varied wildly depending on OS version, audio configuration, and hardware. On Windows, however, the only option is to take an audio cable and loop it from the headphone jack back into the microphone jack, which should also work on Linux and Mac. You could also use an external audio source like an MP3 player and plug it into the microphone jack. In either case, it will likely be needed to play with the output and input level settings. Start at the lowest on everything and slowly increase until the animation starts reacting. What level exactly also depends wildly on the OS, hardware, etc.

Change the `driver = DriverSerial` line to use whatever LED type and orientation you happen to be using as well as the 'w' and 'h' variables to set the width and height.

If you want to try this out now, don't forget that you can use the [BiblioPixel Visualizer](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101128588/allpixel-usb-interface-for-all-your-led-needs/posts/1050419) and see it for yourself.

Happy making!
