It has been an amazing first week! 21 Days to go and we are already at over 200% funding. Thanks so much to all our supporters!

We've also announced some new stretch goals, so [check those out](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101128588/allpixel-usb-interface-for-all-your-led-needs/posts/1049057). We feel certain we will hit the first goal in no time!

One of the coolest things so far though is that we were featured on the [Atmel blog](http://atmelcorporation.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/allpixel-is-like-a-video-card-for-led-strips/)! It's a great honor to get some recognition from such an awesome company. And one that made this project possible!

That's all for now. Keep being awesome and tell your friends!
