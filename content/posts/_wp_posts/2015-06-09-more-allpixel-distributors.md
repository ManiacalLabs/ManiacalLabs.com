One of the major things we've been hard at work on lately is getting AllPixel kits a little closer to those who want them and either missed the Kickstarter or want more. So far, the AllPixel and PowerTap are available from these great distributors near (some of) you:



### Australia






  * [TronixLabs](http://tronixlabs.com/search.php?search_query=AllPixel&x=0&y=0)
  * [Little Bird Electronics](http://littlebirdelectronics.com.au/search?type=product&q=AllPixel)
  * [Pakronics](http://www.pakronics.com/search?type=product&q=AllPixel)




### New Zealand






  * [NiceGear](https://nicegear.co.nz/search/?q=AllPixel)




### United Kingdom






  * [DigitalMeans](https://digitalmeans.co.uk/shop/index.php?route=product/isearch&search=AllPixel&description=true)


For those outside of the above regions, fear not; you can always still order direct from [Seeed](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Maniacallabs-m-165.html?ref=pinfo) and they will ship worldwide.

We are still working hard to land distributors in other regions, especially North America, for which we hope to have good news soon :)

If there is a distributor you would like to see carry our products, there are two things you can do to help!




  * Tell us! Send us a note at contact@maniacallabs.com or leave a comment here with a link to their store.
  * Tell **them**! The best way to get a store to carry a product is to let them know that their customers want it. Sending a quick note to them can go a long way :)


Stay tuned!
