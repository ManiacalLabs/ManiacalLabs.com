A year ago we launched the [AllPixel](/AllPixel) to much success on Kickstarter and, with it, [BiblioPixel](/bibliopixel); our flexible, hardware agnostic animation framework. BiblioPixel makes writing and running your animations easy, and quickly gained in popularity; racking up over 20,000 installs in the last year. Today we are pleased to announce an exciting new update that brings BiblioPixel out of the command line and into your browser... [PixelWeb](/PixelWeb)!

Along with PixelWeb, today we also release a major upgrade to BiblioPixel! In v2.0 you can look forward to all of these great improvements:




  * Interactive Animation/Game Support
  * Input/GamePad handling
  * Animation Queues
  * Texture Maps
  * Transparency
  * Pixel/Display Scaling
  * Improved Image File Handling
  * Better Font Rendering
  * Better Threading Support
  * Global Brightness Handling
  * Up to 300% Faster
  * Many, Many Bug Fixes


We've also moved all animations over to our [BiblioPixelAnimations](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/bibliopixelAnimations) repository, which is automatically installed by PixelWeb. We encourage all BiblioPixel and PixelWeb users to submit any animations they would like to share to the repository!

To quickly get started using PixelWeb, check out the install and usage video below. More information (including how to load your own animations into PixelWeb) will be coming very soon as we build out the [PixelWeb Wiki](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/PixelWeb/wiki), so stay tuned!
