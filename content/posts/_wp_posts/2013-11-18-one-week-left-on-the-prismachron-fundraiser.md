First of all, many, many thanks to those who have supported the [PrismaChron](https://www.tindie.com/products/ManiacalLabs/prismachron-clock/) already! It’s been an interesting first week and we’re part of the way there, but we still have a ways to go.

Unfortunately, if we don’t hit the minimum number of pre-orders, we won’t be able to make the kits cost effective. So we are asking for a little more of your help.

If you can, please share the following link on the social media of your choosing: [https://www.tindie.com/products/ManiacalLabs/prismachron-clock/](https://www.tindie.com/products/ManiacalLabs/prismachron-clock/) Remember, the fundraising period ends at 7am on November 25th (one week from now). All we need is a little nudge!
