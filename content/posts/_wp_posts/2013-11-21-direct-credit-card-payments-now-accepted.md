Good news! Paypal is no longer the only option to purchase our kits! We've gotten some feedback that, even though you don't _have_ to have a PayPal account to checkout in our store, not everyone is keen on the purchase being processed by them.  So, effective immediately, you can pay directly via all major credit cards. For the security concerned, have no fear, our checkout process is fully protected by SSL encryption and even we don't have direct access to any of your credit card information as it's all handled by our processor, [Stripe](http://stripe.com).

Our [Binary Epoch Clock](/products/becv1/) is still on sale, so grab yours now!

And don't forget, our Tindie fundraiser for the [PrismaChron](https://www.tindie.com/products/ManiacalLabs/prismachron-clock/) only has 4 days left. So please give us a hand and support the project!
