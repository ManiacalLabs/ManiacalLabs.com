Earlier this year we were quite excited to receive an invitation from a friend to give a talk at the All Things Open conference, here in Raleigh. They had added a new track on Hardware/IoT and thought our experience might be a great fit. So, after a lot of writing, planning, and practice, we are pleased to present our talk: Open Hardware for Fun And Profit.

Enjoy!
