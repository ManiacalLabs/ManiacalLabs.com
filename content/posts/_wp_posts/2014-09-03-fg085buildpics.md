Not much for today, just a few pics from my build of this nifty kit from Sparkfun: [FG085 MiniDDS Function Generator](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11394). I figure an inexpensive function generator would be a good idea to buy first and see how much I actually use it before sinking bigger bucks into a piece of full-on test gear. Overall, I'm happy with this kit, aside from a few minor quirks here and there. No show-stoppers though.
