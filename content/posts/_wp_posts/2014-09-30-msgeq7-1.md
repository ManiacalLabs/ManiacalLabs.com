Not much today. Just a pair of videos from some testing I've been doing with the [MSGEQ7 Graphic Equalizer Display Filter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10468) chip. The first one shows the waveform of the analog output of the chip.





The second video shows what happens when you take that output and parse it out to a bunch of LPD8806 lights.





If these experiments go any further, I'll do a more in-depth post with code and schematics and stuff. If you have any questions, please let me know in the comments below :)
