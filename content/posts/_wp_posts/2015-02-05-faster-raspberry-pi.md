Previously, I [talked about](/2015/01/01/single-board-linux-computer-rundown/) the [ODROID-C1](http://ameridroid.com/products/odroid-c1) as a possible, faster alternative to the Raspberry Pi. Well, there's a reason I haven't mentioned it again... the software is a mess. It just doesn't have the community around it that the Pi does. Most disappointing was that their USB Serial kernel driver was a total mess and would not work with the AllPixel :( So, that's why I'm so excited about the new [Raspberry Pi 2](http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-2-on-sale/)!

Quad-Core 900MHz CPU with 1GB of RAM in the same lovable Pi package and the same great community?!?! Yes please!

Of course, I already have one on order and will be posting a speed comparison of the new and old Pi running [BiblioPixel](http://github.com/maniacallabs/bibliopixel) performance tests as soon as it's in. There's little doubt it will work as well as the old pi :)
