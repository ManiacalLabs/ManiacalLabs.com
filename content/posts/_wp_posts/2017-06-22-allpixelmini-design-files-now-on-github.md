The recent questioning of if Arduino was [fully complying with open source standards](http://hackaday.com/2017/06/19/the-arduino-foundation-whats-up/) reminded us of something... in all the excitement of releasing the new and improved [AllPixelMini](/AllPixel) we forgot to release the new designs! Oops.

Well, fear not as the KiCAD design files for the AllPixelMini are available for your viewing pleasure over on [GitHub](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/AllPixel/tree/master/PCB/AllPixelMini). And don't worry, the original [AllPixel designs](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/AllPixel/tree/master/PCB/AllPixel) are still available too :)
