Do you live in the Raleigh/Durham area? Are you a fan of the Open Source movement? You're in luck! Check out [RTP 180: Open Source All The Things](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7818877473) on September 17th (for free!). The event features guest speakers from three schools you might have heard (NC State, Duke, and UNC), as well as local members of the Open Source community. In addition to basing our operation on the tenants of Open Source, we here at Maniacal Labs enjoy supporting local people and organizations who champion the cause.

The event is free, they just ask that you RSVP ("buy" a free ticket). See the [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7818877473) page for more details. We'll be there, and we look forward to seeing you there as well!
